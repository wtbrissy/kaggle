In this version there is one player (who you'll control) and a dealer. Play proceeds as follows:\n\nThe player is dealt two face-up cards. The dealer is dealt one face-up card.\nThe player may ask to be dealt another card ('hit') as many times as they wish. If the sum of their cards exceeds 21, they lose the round immediately.\nThe dealer then deals additional cards to himself until either:\nthe sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21, in which case the player wins the round\nthe sum of the dealer's cards is greater than or equal to 17. If the player's total is greater than the dealer's, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins (even in case of a tie).\nWhen calculating the sum of cards, Jack, Queen, and King count for 10. Aces can count as 1 or 11 (when referring to a player's \"total\" above, we mean the largest total that can be made without exceeding 21. So e.g. A+8 = 19, A+8+8 = 17)\n\nFor this problem, you'll write a function representing the player's decision-making strategy in this game.
